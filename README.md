Made this.
Ran out of motivation to keep working on it.
Don't know if it's good.
Anyone sees it and thinks it's good, you're free to copy it, do whatever you want with it, take all the credit.
I'm not a real programmer. Just a bored dabbler.
Spent the time and effort to write it.
Wanted it posted somewhere on the off chance it's something useful.
If not, no harm no foul.
